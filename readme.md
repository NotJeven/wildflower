### Wildflower

Wildflower is a bow and arrow based Minecraft PvP game originally created by @leMoesh and @RixiotGhilitao. Their project was released to the public sometime in 2015 and serves as the base for this project.

This is a re-implementation of the game for Minecraft 1.13. A few gameplay creative liberties will be taken.
